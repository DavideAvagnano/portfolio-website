# Davide Avagnano's Portfolio Website

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, where I showcase my projects, skills, and experience in web development. This site is built using the latest technologies to deliver a smooth, aesthetic, and high-performance user experience. Below, you will find detailed information about the technologies used, features of the site, and deployment details.

## Features

- **Built with Next.js 15**: This site utilizes Next.js for its powerful SSR (Server-Side Rendering) capabilities, allowing for fast load times and SEO-friendly content. The server-side rendering helps in improving performance by rendering pages at request time.
- **Server Actions**: The site integrates server actions to handle form submissions securely and efficiently, ensuring data is validated and processed on the server before any actions are taken.
- **ShadCN**: A design system that provides a consistent and modular approach to styling components across the site. It simplifies the development process and maintains a clean, organized codebase.
- **Zod for Form Validation**: For the contact form, I utilized Zod for robust form validation. This ensures all user inputs are properly validated before submission, and it provides clear feedback to the user.
- **Email Sending with Resend**: The contact form integrates with Resend to send emails directly from the site. It provides a seamless experience for users and ensures that messages are sent securely.
- **High Performance**: The site has been optimized for performance, scoring high on tools like Google Lighthouse for speed, accessibility, and SEO.

## Projects and Skills Showcase

- **Project Overviews**: Detailed descriptions of each project, highlighting the technologies used, challenges faced, and the final outcome.
- **Skills**: A section dedicated to my skills in web development, including front-end technologies (Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS), backend technologies (Node.js, Prisma, PostgreSQL), and more.
- **Animations with Framer Motion**: The site features dynamic animations created using Framer Motion, enhancing user interaction and visual appeal.

## Deployment

- **Vercel Deployment**: The website is deployed on Vercel, leveraging its global CDN for fast and reliable hosting. This ensures that users worldwide have a smooth experience when visiting the site.
